# Password Generator

## User Story 

As a developer, I want to create an application to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
in order to have a strong password that provides better security.

## Acceptance Criteria 

Since I want a new password, I have to be able to click the button to generate a password. From this, the user will be given prompts to answer. 

These prompts include the length of the password (at least 8 characters & maximum of 128 characters), character types, and whether or not the person wants to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

Lastly, the password is either displayed in an alert and should successfully meet the requirements.
